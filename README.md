# Full Stack Development Course

As part of full stack development course, our final project is to create a blog website.
At first I was asked to write some HTML + CSS code to implement the home page's structure of my blog, and then show it using gh-pages as in here:
https://oshri-garama.github.io/blog/

In this part we were asked convert it into React Application, and deploy it using gh-pages.
This is the results:
