Task #4

we were asked to create database in mysql and implement backend routes for: get all posts, add new post using Flask, requests and Jsonify in python,
then we had to connect the routes to the frontend - with axios.
This time we didn't upload it to gh-pages.

Task #5

We added functionality for user managmanet: sign up, log in, log out.
using bcrypt to hash the password given by the user and cookies to specify session.
