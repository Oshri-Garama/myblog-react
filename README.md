# Full Stack Development Course


As part of full stack development course, our final project is to create a blog website.

Task #1

At first I was asked to write some HTML + CSS code to implement the home page's structure of my blog, and then show it using gh-pages as in here:

Task #2

Task #4

we were asked to implement backend using Flask, requests and Jsonify
then we needed to connect the routes to the frontend - with axios.
This time we didn't upload it to gh-pages.
